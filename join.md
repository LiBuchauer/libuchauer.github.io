### Join us

If you are interested in learning more about the group, we invite you to get in touch. While prior experience with computational biology is a plus, the most important requirement is motivation!

#### Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, MD theses, lab rotation projects, internships
If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options. Please reach out to me with your CV at [lisa.buchauer@charite.de](mailto:lisa.buchauer@charite.de).

#### PhD

We are currently looking for a PhD student to join our computational biology / bioinformatics research group which is embedded in a translational environment.

The work will start with an onboarding project around understanding the mechanistic differences between host immune responses against different viral vaccines based on bulk and single-cell RNAseq data of virus-infected cells. The data for this is waiting. Potential projects after that would likely stem from one of two collaboration areas with experimental labs at Charité, depending on the candidates’ interest: 1) construction of a quantitative mouse lung atlas from single cell and spatial transcriptomics data in combination with high-resolution electron microscopy data / development of methods for mechanistic interpretation of spatial transcriptomics data and 2) a project in the area of circadian medicine, where we will attempt to assign circadian phases to individual cells based on single cell omics and/or flow cytometry data and analyse resulting phase distributions in health and disease.

For further details on how to apply please see the full call here: https://jobs.bihealth.org/PhD-Position-in-Computational-Immunology-with-Translationa-eng-j561.html 

Your are welcome to reach out with your questions to lisa.buchauer@charite.de .

Looking forward to receiving your application!

#### PostDoc 
There are currently no explicit PostDoc positions to be filled, but qualified candidates interested in PhD or PostDoc opportunities are welcome to reach out to discuss potential funding options.  

We are interested in candidates from quantitative backgrounds (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python, R, Julia) is required. Candidates with life science background (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are also welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with any of the following is considered a plus: omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required.
