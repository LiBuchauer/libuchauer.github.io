### Join us

If you are interested in learning more about the group, we invite you to get in touch. While prior experience with computational biology is a plus, the most important requirement is motivation!

#### Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, MD theses, lab rotation projects, internships
If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options. Please reach out to me with your CV at [lisa.buchauer@charite.de](mailto:lisa.buchauer@charite.de).

#### PhD / PostDoc 
There are currently no explicit positions to be filled, but qualified candidates interested in PhD or PostDoc opportunities are welcome to reach out to discuss potential funding options.  

We are interested in candidates from quantitative backgrounds (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python, R, Julia) is required. Candidates with life science background (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are also welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with any of the following is considered a plus: omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required.
