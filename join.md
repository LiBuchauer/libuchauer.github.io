### Join us
If you are interested in learning more about the group, we invite you to get in touch. While prior experience with computational biology is a plus, the most important requirement is motivation!

#### Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, MD theses, lab rotation projects, internships
If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options. Please reach out to me __with your CV, your transcript of records as well as one paragraph describing a previous research project of yours, ideally a computational one,__ at [lisa.buchauer@charite.de](mailto:lisa.buchauer@charite.de). For bachelor's students without prior research experience, it is okay to describe a class project instead.

#### PhD & PostDoc
There are currently no specific positions open, but interestes candidates are invited to reach out if applying for funding jointly is an option for them.

We are interested in candidates from quantitative backgrounds (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python, R, Julia) is required. Candidates with life science background (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are also welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with any of the following is considered a plus: omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required.
