### Recruiting a student assisstant (start early 2026)!
We are looking for a student research assistant (studentische Hilfskraft) to join our team starting in February or March 2026 for a period of nine months at 40 hours per month.

We are a computational biology and bioinformatics research group with a focus on single-cell omics data in immunology and infectious diseases (https://buchauer-lab.eu/). This position is part of the newly funded Collaborative Research Center TRR 418 "Foundations of Circadian Medicine."

The successful candidate will curate, process, and integrate publicly available omics datasets related to circadian rhythms into a database with a web interface that we are currently developing. The primary focus will be on bulk RNA-seq data, though single-cell RNA-seq and proteomics datasets will also be relevant.

We are looking for a reliable, detail-oriented, and self-motivated person who is currently enrolled in a degree program in bioinformatics, computational biology, or a related field. Proficiency in Python or R is required, and prior experience with transcriptomics data analysis is a strong advantage.

The position is based at Campus Virchow-Klinikum.

If you are interested, please send your CV, transcript of records, and a short motivation letter that includes a brief description of one previous bioinformatics project you have worked on to lisa.buchauer@charite.de .

#### Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, MD theses, lab rotation projects, internships
If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options. Please reach out to me __with your CV, your transcript of records as well as one paragraph describing a previous research project of yours, ideally a computational one,__ at [lisa.buchauer@charite.de](mailto:lisa.buchauer@charite.de). For bachelor's students without prior research experience, it is okay to describe a class project instead.

#### PhD & PostDoc
There are currently no specific positions open, but interestes candidates are invited to reach out if applying for funding jointly is an option for them.

We are interested in candidates from quantitative backgrounds (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python, R, Julia) is required. Candidates with life science background (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are also welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with any of the following is considered a plus: omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required.
