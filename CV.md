#### Lisa Buchauer

I am professor of Systems Biology of Infectious Diseases at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care at Charité - University Medicine, Berlin.  

Previously, I worked as a Senior Computational Biologist and Project Team Lead at immunai, Inc. in Tel Aviv. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Science and a PhD student at the German Cancer Research Center.  

As a computational biologist with a background in physics, I develop computational methods for omics data, analyse such data, and build mathematical models of biological systems with a focus on the immune system.
