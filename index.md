### Welcome!

<img style="width:12em" src="images/buchauer_lab.png" align="right">
Our group collaborates with experimentalists and clinicians on translational infectious disease & fundamental immunology research projects and develops computational tools for the analysis of omics and flow data.  

Our research includes analyzing, modeling, and interpreting high-dimensional biomedical datasets, comprising single-cell or bulk omics assays, spatial assays, flow cytometry data and more. Approaches employed by and developed in our lab include - but are not limited to - mathematical models, computer simulations, and machine learning methods. 

In computational method development, our primary objective is to create tools that facilitate the informative fusion of data from various sources, such as different modalities, technologies or diseases. We conceive, prototype and develop algorithms to this end, but also emphasize thorough benchmarking, usability, reproducibility and maintenance.

### News
__Dec 12th 2023__
We are currently looking to recruit an MD thesis student for a project on infection diagnostics based on host immune response data. Please check out the corresponding [project description](https://libuchauer.github.io/MD23)!
