### Welcome!

<img style="width:12em" src="images/buchauer_lab.png" align="right">
We are a theoretical research group working in computational immunology. We develop computational tools for the analysis of omics and flow data. We also collaborate with experimentalists and clinicians on translational infectious disease & fundamental immunology research projects. 

Our research includes analyzing, modeling, and interpreting high-dimensional biomedical datasets, comprising single-cell or bulk omics assays, spatial assays, flow cytometry data and more. Approaches employed by and developed in our lab include - but are not limited to - mathematical models, computer simulations, and machine learning methods. 

In computational method development, our primary objective is to create tools that facilitate the informative fusion of data from various sources, such as different modalities, technologies or diseases. We conceive, prototype and develop algorithms to this end, but also emphasize thorough benchmarking, usability, reproducibility and maintenance.
