### Welcome!

<img style="width:9em" src="images/buchauer_lab.png" align="right">
Our group collaborates with experimentalists and clinicians on translational infectious disease & fundamental immunology research projects and develops computational tools for the analysis of omics and flow data.  

Our research includes analyzing, modeling, and interpreting high-dimensional biomedical datasets, comprising single-cell or bulk omics assays, spatial assays, clinical data and more. Approaches employed by and developed in our lab include - but are not limited to - mathematical models, computer simulations, and machine learning methods. 

In computational method development, our primary objective is to create tools that facilitate the informative fusion of data from various sources, such as different modalities, technologies or diseases. We conceive, prototype and develop algorithms to this end, but also emphasize thorough benchmarking, usability, reproducibility and maintenance.

If you are interested in learning more about the group or are interested in joining, I invite you to check out the [lab](https://libuchauer.github.io/lab/) page and get in touch. While prior experience with computational biology is a plus, the most important requirement is motivation!

If you have bulk RNAseq data that you want to deconvolve and are looking for a method that is accurate, fast and, above all, user-friendly, please check out [cellanneal](https://github.com/LiBuchauer/cellanneal) and the accompanying [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08209).
