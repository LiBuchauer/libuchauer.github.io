## Upcoming PhD positions in my new research group at Charité Berlin

Official calls for two PhD positions in my lab will open soon (summer 2023). However, interested candidates that fit the below profile are already invited to get in touch via email.
Our group is part of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Charité - University Medicine Berlin, a highly collaborative and welcoming work environment with a translational focus. 
The desired start date is between September 1st and November 1st, 2023. The initial contract duration is 3 years. The position is remunerated according to German public service pay scale (65% TV-L 13).

### Our research interests

Our group collaborates with experimentalists and clinicians on translational infectious disease research projects and develops computational tools for the analysis of omics data. Candidates are expected to contribute to both areas, but can set their own emphasis according to their interests and skills.  

In collaboration projects, your research includes analyzing, modeling, and interpreting high-dimensional biomedical datasets, comprising single-cell or bulk omics assays, spatial assays, clinical data and more. Tools you will employ and develop may include - but are not limited to - mathematical models, computer simulations and machine learning approaches. Current collaboration opportunities include immune responses, therapeutic interventions and vaccine design against respiratory infections, nosocomial infections, HIV and tuberculosis.  

In computational method development, our primary objective is to create tools that facilitate the informative fusion of data from various sources, such as different modalities, technologies or diseases. Your research will include developing and prototyping ideas, benchmarking competing approaches as well as productizing and maintaining your software.  

### Your profile

We are looking for candidates with a master’s degree in a quantitative discipline (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python or R) is required. Candidates with a master’s degree in a life science (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work are all considered a plus. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required.

## Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, lab rotation projects, internships

If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options.
