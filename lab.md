### Our research interests
<img style="width:9em" src="images/buchauer_lab.png" align="right">
Our group collaborates with experimentalists and clinicians on translational infectious disease & fundamental immunology research projects and develops computational tools for the analysis of omics data.  

Our research includes analyzing, modeling, and interpreting high-dimensional biomedical datasets, comprising single-cell or bulk omics assays, spatial assays, clinical data and more. Approaches employed by and developed in our lab include - but are not limited to - mathematical models, computer simulations, and machine learning methods. 

In computational method development, our primary objective is to create tools that facilitate the informative fusion of data from various sources, such as different modalities, technologies or diseases. We conceive, prototype and develop algorithms to this end, but also emphasize thorough benchmarking, usability, reproducibility and maintenance.
  

### Join us
#### PhD / PostDoc 
There are currently no explicit positions to be filled, but qualified candidates interested in PhD or PostDoc opportunities are welcome to reach out to discuss potential funding options.  

We are interested in candidates from quantitative backgrounds (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python, R, Julia) is required. Candidates with life science background (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are also welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with any of the following is considered a plus: omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required.


#### Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, MD theses, lab rotation projects, internships

If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options. Please reach out to me at [lisa.buchauer@charite.de](mailto:lisa.buchauer@charite.de) .
