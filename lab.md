### 2 PhD positions in my new research group at Charité Berlin
<img style="width:7em" src="images/buchauer_lab.png" align="right">

I am looking for 2 PhD students to join my recently established computational research group on “Systems Biology of Infectious Diseases”. The group is part of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, a highly collaborative, international and welcoming work environment with a translational focus.

The successful candidates will work on unique high-dimensional datasets from clinical and laboratory studies, develop novel computational methods for their analysis and become a part of the thriving computational biology and data science community in Berlin. We will make your professional development our priority and provide you with a skill set in high demand in academic and industrial careers alike. 

The desired start date is between September 1st and November 1st, 2023. The initial contract duration is 3 years. The position is remunerated according to German public service pay scale (65% TV-L 13).


#### Our research interests

Our group collaborates with experimentalists and clinicians on translational infectious disease & fundamental immunology research projects and develops computational tools for the analysis of omics data. Candidates are expected to contribute to both areas, but can set their own emphasis according to their interests and skills.  

Your research will include analyzing, modeling, and interpreting high-dimensional biomedical datasets, comprising single-cell or bulk omics assays, spatial assays, clinical data and more. Approaches you will employ and develop may include - but are not limited to - mathematical models, computer simulations, and machine learning methods. Collaboration opportunities include immune responses, therapeutic interventions and vaccine design against respiratory infections, nosocomial infections, HIV and tuberculosis.  

In computational method development, our primary objective is to create tools that facilitate the informative fusion of data from various sources, such as different modalities, technologies or diseases. Your research will include developing and prototyping ideas, benchmarking competing approaches as well as productionizing and maintaining your software.
  

#### Your profile

We are looking for candidates with a __master’s degree in a quantitative discipline__ (physics, mathematics, computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics or similar) with a desire to apply their skills to biomedical research questions. Good command of at least one programming language (e.g. python, R, Julia) is required. Candidates with a __master’s degree in a life science__ (biology, biomedicine, biochemistry or similar) are welcome to apply if they have a strong analytical side and the desire to expand their theoretical and computational skills.  

Prior experience with any of the following is considered a plus: omics data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, spatial or temporal data analysis, software development principles and biological wet-lab work. Candidates should be curious, willing to work in a multidisciplinary team, and have a strong sense of ownership for their projects. Fluency in English is required (B2-C1).

__Please send your CV, a one-page motivation letter and the contact information of at least one reference directly to lisa.buchauer@charite.de as a single pdf by July 31st, 2023. Informal enquiries are encouraged; I am looking forward to receiving your application!__


### Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, MD theses, lab rotation projects, internships

If you are interested in doing any of the above in my lab, I will be happy to hear from you to discuss your interests and currently available project options. Please reach out to me at lisa.buchauer@charite.de .
