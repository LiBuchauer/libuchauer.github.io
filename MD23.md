#### MD / Dr. med. project available: "Deconvolution-enhanced infection classification based on host blood RNA sequencing data"

We are looking for a Charité medical student to join us for their MD thesis. The work will include identifying relevant datasets in the literature, bioinformatic processing of such datasets, comparing and benchmarking computational approaches and building and testing machine learning models. A start date in Q1 2024 is desired. We will aim for a doctorate by publication.

#### Background
Diagnosis of infections is based on a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests and imaging studies. However, accuracy and sensitivity of laboratory tests is sometimes poor, turnover times for test results may be long, relevant tissues may not be accessible for direct sampling, and significant diagnostic uncertainty often remains even after all results have been obtained. For these reasons, there is research interest in diagnostics based on host immune responses sampled from the peripheral blood.
In this project, we will evaluate the potential of RNA sequencing data of patient whole blood samples for precision diagnostics and infection classification using machine-learning approaches.

#### Aims
1.	Assess the potential of computational methods for estimating immune cell type fractions from whole blood bulk RNA sequencing data using single-cell transcriptomics data
2.	Develop a multi-infection classifier, which draws on bulk RNA gene expression values as well as estimated immune cell type proportions using publicly available datasets
3.	Apply and refine our classifier with in-house datasets from Charité's Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care.

#### What we are looking for
-	Curious individuals with interest in quantitative / computational work in an interdisciplinary, translational context
-	Basic programming skills in python, R or similar OR commitment to complete a relevant online course (e.g. [“data analysis for life sciences”](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-analysis-for-life-sciences) (participation is free, you do not need to pay for the certification))
-	Candidates who are at least in the 7th semester of their medical studies

#### What we offer
-	Work in an international computational team (https://libuchauer.github.io/team/) with strong ties to experimentalists and clinicians
-	Friendly, supportive environment with flexible work hours
-	Work with state-of the art computational methods for the analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data sets (e.g. omics data), access to high-power compute facilities
-	Support with scholarship applications and conference participation

#### How to apply
Please send your CV as well as a short paragraph outlining your motivation and a description of your prior experience with computational / data analysis projects (if applicable) to lisa.buchauer@charite.de. If you are interested in the project but unsure whether you are qualified, please do not self-exclude but reach out with your questions.
