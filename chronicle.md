As a member of the [Young Academy](https://www.diejungeakademie.de), Lisa participated in the BBAW's scientific new year's reception, the [Salon Sophie Charlotte](https://salon.bbaw.de/start). This year's event was themed "Metamorphoses", and the members of the Young Academy invited visitors to engange with their research via a specially designed card game, [MetaMonster](https://diejungeakademie.de/de/projekte/salon-sophie-charlotte/salon-sophie-charlotte-2025).
