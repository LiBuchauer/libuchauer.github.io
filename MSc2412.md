#### M.Sc. thesis project available: "Computational Methods for Determining Circadian Phase from Single-Cell Transcriptomics Data"

We are looking for a bioinformatics (or similar, e.g. Charité Master Molecular Medicine) student to join us for a master's thesis project. The available project focuses on developing computational single cell methods for chronobiology applications in collaboration with the Kramer lab, also at Charité. Chronobiology and -medicine revolve around biological rhythms and their significance in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here, we are looking to predict circadian phase for individual cells based on single-cell RNAseq data - a task which is challenging due to sparsity and noise typical of such data - using state of the art single cell analysis methods. A previous master’s student has generated first promising results in this direction which we are looking to expand on for publication.

Candidates must be available to work in the lab full time for at least 6 months. The desired start date ist between December 2024 and March 2025. Applicants who have demonstrated prior computational project experience (i.e. at least one computational lab rotation project or equivalent) are welcome to reach out to me via mail at lisa.buchauer@charite.de with a short paragraph describing their motivation and their CV and transcript of records attached.
